# HandTracker
Software for those who have neglected their hand/wrist health

I'd like to make an app/software for those who have neglected their hand/wrist health. This would be a "HandManager", an app that shows the user the motions and a timer for proper stretches to assist in preventing/reducing the impact of carpal tunnel on the wrist. To avoid carpal tunnel and other hand-related issues that can arise from those working at a job or take part in a hobby where repetitive hand motions are commonplace.
	I find this topic important due to my own experience with carpal tunnel in the past few years, caused by an addiction to video games that I have happily kicked. Not everyone can afford the surgery required to fix carpal tunnel, and there are multiple preventive measures one can take to avoid dealing with the condition in the future. If I turn more attention to prevention, rather than spending $1000+ to fix it in the future, I can build a product/idea that will save users precious time and money in the long run.
	The app will have a list/selection of stretches to select from, as well as a timer for how long you will have to maintain the stretch. There will also be a timer for how long the user should rest before beginning the next set of stretches. I plan to have a way to log the userâ€™s progress in the app, or even have a way of scheduling how the user wants to set up their routine for the week.

I have changed the app I will base my project from. It is now todoist-scheduler: https://github.com/uaikhuel/todoist-scheduler

This is a '1' Person project
